Made with Visual Basic, this is a barebones Calendar app that is totally minimal, yet fully functional for the average person.  It is based on the familiar Windows 7 Calendar.

How to use:

1. Click on a date to add a note to the date.  
   * Adding a note/event will bold the date on the Calendar. Delete the text to unbold the date.
   * Typing "mtg" and "bday" will auto-format to "Meeting" and "Birthday" underlined.
   * Time ranges without spaces or colons such as 9am-330pm will auto-format to "9:00 AM - 3:30 PM" when pressing Enter.
2. Add a Microsoft/Outlook/Hotmail account (used for To & From with SMTP) to enable email Alerts.
   * If there was an note entered for the current date, the note will be emailed to you at 8am.
   * Password is stored locally as plaintext. Update the source code or use at your own risk.  

Use Visual Studio to open the project and tweak the program to your preferences.
